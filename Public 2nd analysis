EFNet6 ensemble_5 clip_1e-15

s3fdfacedetector 이라는 얼굴 디텍터를 사용한게 특징인데, import 하는데 어려움 겪는중
1st 코드의 mtcnn 가져와서 활용해보려고 시도중

# Imported as package because pip installation requires internet to download weights for detector
# I've modified the code to remove all stuff related to landmarks extraction, so I've used only s3fd detection module
